### About the Datasets
Our datasets were captured in an outdoor real-world surveillance scenario using modern IP cameras (Hikvision DS-2CD2625FWD-IZS), capable of multiple concurrent streams. This setup allowed us to generate closely related HR and LR image datasets, which are crucial for producing effective SR models. The dataset configuration is as follows:

The dataset includes different configurations for HR and LR streams, detailed in the following table:
